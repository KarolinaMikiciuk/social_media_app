# SOCIAL MEDIA APP 

* This is a simple backend code for a social media app.
* It's implemented using OOP and developed using TDD.
* It's also my first PHP project. 
* I think I started learning PHP on either the 20th or 21st January. So I guess it's not too bad.

## CLONING THE PROJECT
* Clone the repository.
* Run "composer install"
