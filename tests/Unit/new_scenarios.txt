// Scenario 8

Given user with username John exists
Given user with username Jane exists
Given user with username Rick exists
Given Jane is a friend of John
Given Rick is a friend of John
Given Jane was John's friend before Rick was
When I get friends of John
Then an array with Jane and Rick objects
is returned in the order: Jane, Rick.

hint: the order of friend objects is the same
as of friendship objects i.e. in chronological
order
index 0 friend corresponds to index 0 friendship
hint: perhaps test this scenario in reverse order,too


// Scenario 10
Given user with username John exists
Given user with username Jane exists
Given Jane has blocked John
When Jane blocks John again
Then text "You have already blocked this user" 
is displayed
